He has consistently missed due dates and often fails to make the minimum required payments. His payment behavior suggests a high risk of default and a lack of financial responsibility.\\nFinancial_circumstances: Albert's financial situation is unstable. He has a history of frequent job changes and irregular income. His expenses often exceed his income, leading to a persistent negative cash flow. Albert has also accumulated significant credit card debt, indicating a pattern of overspending.\\nCommunication: Past loan agents have reported difficulty in communicating with Albert. He tends to avoid conversations about his financial obligations and has been unresponsive to collection efforts. Albert's lack of engagement and willingness to cooperate negatively impacts his creditworthiness.\\nCredit_worthiness: Based on the information available, Albert is considered a high-risk borrower with low creditworthiness. His negative payment history, unstable financial circumstances, and poor communication record suggest a strong likelihood of default. Lenders should exercise caution when considering extending credit to Albert.\"]\n"

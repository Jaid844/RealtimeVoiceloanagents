      "Even after stepping down from Apple in 2011, Jobs continued to influence the tech world. He invested in various companies, including Tesla Motors and SolarCity, demonstrating his continued belief in disruptive innovation. He passed away in 2011 at the age of 56, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire and shape the future.\n",
